# An-Analysis-of-Passing-Rates-and-Winning-Outcomes-in-the-Bundesliga
ABSTRACT
This report presents an analysis of passing rates and their relationship with match outcomes in the 1st soccer division in Germany (1. Bundesliga). The study investigates whether a higher passing rate correlates with a higher likelihood of winning a soccer game. Data from the first half of a given season were analyzed, including passing rates for both winning and losing teams, as well as games ending in a draw. The research questions focused on determining if winning teams exhibit higher passing rates compared to losing teams and if the difference in passing rates between winning and losing teams is greater than in drawn games. Through statistical analysis and interpretation, insights were gained into the importance of passing rates in determining match outcomes, providing valuable information for coaches, players, analysts, and enthusiasts in optimizing team strategies and tactics.
